# ISU-Projects

About Me:
My name is Karson Goone and I am a student at ISU majoring in cybersecurity. I wanted to go into cybersecurity because I originally wanted to go into computer programming but after researching the field thoroughly I was worried if the field wasn't what I wanted to do with the rest of my life so I decided to start looking for different majors of computer science and I came across cybersecurity which was crazy because after researching it out I remembered being fascinated by the field when I was younger because there was a show called "Mr. Robot" that I watched. I want to get a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity. I want to become a security engineer hopefully in a good company that faces many different interesting problems. I've been so excited to learn more about the field I started to take some online courses in Tryhackme to come into class already understanding some of the basics so I can focus on the harder math classes. I always try to be the best in my field and I know that is an impossible task for a career but I always want to atleast be in the higher percentile in my class because I don't want to be left behind in a class and never recover.
